		<p> One August morning, people living near the Akouedo rubbish dump in Abidjan,
			capital of the Ivory Coast, woke up to a foul-smelling air. Soon, they began to vomit,
			children got diarrhoea, and the elderly found it difficult to breathe. "The smell was unbelievable,
			a cross between rotten eggs and blocked drains," said one Abidjan resident.
			"After 10 minutes in the thick of it, I felt sick." - ("Toxic Shock - How Western
			Trash Is Destroying Africa") </p>

		<p> "A substantial proportion of e-waste exports go to countries outside Europe,
			including west African countries. Treatment in these countries usually occurs in the informal sector,
			causing significant environmental pollution and health risks for local populations." - Spokesman (Interpol) </p>
