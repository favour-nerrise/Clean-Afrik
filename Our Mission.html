		<p> One August morning, people living near the Akouedo rubbish dump in Abidjan,
			capital of the Ivory Coast, woke up to a foul-smelling air. Soon, they began to vomit,
			children got diarrhoea, and the elderly found it difficult to breathe. "The smell was unbelievable,
			a cross between rotten eggs and blocked drains," said one Abidjan resident.
			"After 10 minutes in the thick of it, I felt sick." - Patricia Doyle ("Toxic Shock - How Western
			Trash Is Destroying Africa") </p>
		<br> </br>
		<p> Unfortunately, many countries in West Africa suffer from mass polution and accumulation of waste like the Ivory Coast.
			West Africans depend on agricultural income to foster daily expenses. However, this is hindered by the absence of a proper
			means to dispose of waste. "When I was younger, I remember throwing away leftovers in the backyard. I didn't know about
			 trash cans nor did I even think of cleaning up a better way. Instead, we believed that by emptying our mess on the ground,
			 we would be giving back to the Earth. Thinking back, I wouldn't want to do it again seeing as the smell of rotten
			 peels, vegetables, and decayed food was horrendous." - Favour Nerrise
	 		"A substantial proportion of e-waste exports go to countries outside Europe,
			including west African countries. Treatment in these countries usually occurs in the informal sector,
			causing significant environmental pollution and health risks for local populations." - Spokesman (Interpol) </p>
